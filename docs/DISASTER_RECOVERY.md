## Recovery Procedures

### Repository Recovery

#### Scenario 1: GitHub Repository Compromise

**Immediate Response (0-1 hour):**
1. Contact GitHub security team
2. Revoke all access tokens and SSH keys
3. Change all account passwords
4. Document the incident

**Recovery Steps (1-4 hours):**
1. Create new repository if needed
2. Restore from GitLab mirror:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/nushell-works/nu_plugin_secret.git
   git remote add github https://github.com/nushell-works/nu_plugin_secret.git
   git push github --all
   git push github --tags
   ```
3. Verify integrity with known good checksums
4. Audit all recent commits for malicious changes
5. Update security credentials

**Post-Recovery (4-24 hours):**
1. Security audit of all code changes
2. Rebuild and re-release affected versions
3. Notify community of security incident
4. Implement additional security measures

#### Scenario 2: Complete Data Loss

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Restore from most recent tertiary backup:
   ```bash
   gpg --decrypt nu_plugin_secret-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz.gpg | tar -xzf -
   cd repo-backup-YYYYMMDD
   git clone --bare . /path/to/new/repo.git
   ```
2. Push to new GitHub repository
3. Recreate GitHub configuration (webhooks, secrets, etc.)
4. Restore CI/CD pipelines
5. Verify data integrity

### Infrastructure Recovery

#### CI/CD Pipeline Recovery

**GitHub Actions Recovery:**
1. Restore workflow files from backup
2. Recreate repository secrets:
   - `CRATES_TOKEN`
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN`  
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic)
3. Test all workflows with dry-run
4. Monitor first actual runs

**Release Infrastructure Recovery:**
1. Verify binary signing capabilities
2. Test release automation
3. Validate artifact distribution
4. Check monitoring and alerting

#### DNS and Domain Recovery

**Domain Recovery Steps:**
1. Verify domain registration status
2. Update DNS records if needed:
   - A records for website
   - CNAME for documentation
   - MX records for email
3. Restore SSL certificates
4. Test all services

### Security Incident Response

#### Compromised Signing Keys

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Revoke compromised keys immediately
2. Generate new signing keys
3. Update key distribution channels
4. Re-sign all recent releases

**Key Rotation Process:**
```bash
# Generate new GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# Export public key
gpg --armor --export KEY_ID > new-public-key.asc

# Sign new key with old key (if available)
gpg --sign-key NEW_KEY_ID

# Update GitHub and crates.io
```

#### Malicious Code Injection

**Response Process:**
1. Immediately remove malicious code
2. Audit entire codebase history
3. Identify affected releases
4. Create clean release with fixes
5. Notify all users via security advisory
