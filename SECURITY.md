# Security Policy

## üîê Security-First Philosophy

`nu_plugin_secret` is designed with security as the primary concern. This plugin handles sensitive data and implements multiple layers of protection to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Display Protection**: Secret values always display as `<redacted:type>` regardless of context
- **Memory Safety**: Automatic memory zeroing on drop using `zeroize` crate
- **Serialization Protection**: Prevention of accidental exposure through JSON/YAML/etc.
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Secure comparisons to prevent timing attacks
- **Type System Enforcement**: Rust's type system prevents accidental access

### Implementation Security
- **Zero Unsafe Code**: No use of `unsafe` blocks in security-critical paths
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security audits of all dependencies
- **Memory Layout**: Careful attention to memory layout and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Security-conscious error messages that don't leak information

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ‚úÖ Current         |

## üîç Security Vulnerabilities

### Reporting Process

**‚ö†Ô∏è Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/nushell-works/nu_plugin_secret/security) of this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the private security advisory form
4. Submit the report

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment

[If you have ideas for fixing the issue]

## Additional Context
[Any other relevant information]
```

### Our Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fixes
- **30 days**: Target for releasing security patches (varies by severity)

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the plugin
2. **Minimize Unwrapping**: Only use `secret unwrap` when absolutely necessary
3. **Validate Inputs**: Use `secret validate` to ensure you're working with secret types
4. **Audit Usage**: Regularly review your code for proper secret handling
5. **Environment Security**: Secure the environment where you use the plugin

### For Developers

1. **Security Review**: All code changes must consider security implications
2. **Test Security Properties**: Include security-focused tests
3. **Memory Safety**: Always use secure memory practices
4. **Dependency Auditing**: Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
5. **Documentation**: Document security implications of all features

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Memory Safety**: Miri testing for undefined behavior detection
- **Dependency Auditing**: `cargo audit` for known vulnerabilities  
- **License Compliance**: `cargo deny` for license and security policy enforcement
- **Static Analysis**: Clippy with security-focused lints
- **Coverage Analysis**: Comprehensive test coverage including security scenarios

### Manual Security Testing

We recommend:

- **Memory Leak Testing**: Valgrind or similar tools
- **Timing Attack Testing**: Statistical analysis of operation timing
- **Serialization Testing**: Verify no sensitive data in outputs
- **Error Message Review**: Ensure error messages don't leak secrets
- **Integration Testing**: Test with various Nushell configurations

## üîé Security Audit History

### Planned Audits
- **Q1 2025**: Initial security audit before v1.0 release
- **Ongoing**: Continuous automated security scanning

### Past Audits
- **None yet**: This is a new project, first audit planned

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

- [ ] **Tests**: Added security-focused tests
- [ ] **Documentation**: Documented security implications

## üö´ Common Security Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Patterns

```rust
// ‚ùå DON'T: Exposing content in Display/Debug
impl Display for SecretString {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.inner) // ‚ùå Exposes secret!
    }
}

// ‚ùå DON'T: Variable-time operations
impl PartialEq for SecretString {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.inner == other.inner // ‚ùå Timing attack possible!
    }
}

// ‚ùå DON'T: Logging sensitive data
pub fn process_secret(secret: &SecretString) {
    eprintln!("Processing: {}", secret.inner); // ‚ùå Logs secret!
}
```

### Use These Patterns Instead

```rust
// ‚úÖ DO: Always redact in Display/Debug
impl Display for SecretString {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "<redacted:string>") // ‚úÖ Never exposes content
    }
}

// ‚úÖ DO: Constant-time operations
impl PartialEq for SecretString {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;
        self.inner.as_bytes().ct_eq(other.inner.as_bytes()).into()
    }
}

// ‚úÖ DO: Secure logging
pub fn process_secret(secret: &SecretString) {
    eprintln!("Processing secret of length: {}", secret.len()); // ‚úÖ Safe metadata only
}
```
